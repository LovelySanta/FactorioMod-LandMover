A mod that removes the recipy of landfill (configurable). If you want to landfill, you can craft land mover (if researched). Dig a hole, and get the land (it will be replaced by water as you dig under the sea level). You'll get landfill in your inventory instead. Now you can replace your digged up land somewhere else!
